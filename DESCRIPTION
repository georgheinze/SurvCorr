Description: Estimates correlation coefficients with associated
   confidence limits 
   for bivariate, partially censored survival times. Uses
   the iterative multiple imputation approach proposed

   in Medicine 2013. Provides a scatterplot function to visualize the bivariate 
   distribution, either on the original time scale or as copula.
